VoxCore is an open source push to talk transcription tool for macOS. It provides universal voice input that works in any application. The project uses a plugin architecture where the core handles fast stateless transcription and optional plugins add advanced features. VoxCompose is the official plugin that provides machine learning based refinement including self learning corrections and vocabulary building. Everything runs locally on your Mac with zero cloud dependencies. The system is designed for privacy and speed, processing most recordings in under one second. It supports automatic model selection based on recording duration, choosing between a fast model for short clips and a more accurate model for longer recordings.
