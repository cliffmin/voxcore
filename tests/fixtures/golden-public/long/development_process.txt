The development workflow for this project follows standard best practices. Changes are made on feature branches and submitted as pull requests. The continuous integration pipeline runs Java unit tests, validation checks, code quality analysis, and benchmark regression tests. All required checks must pass before merging. Releases follow semantic versioning with the version number tracked in the Gradle build file and changelog. When releasing, we create a git tag which triggers the release workflow to build artifacts and create a GitHub release. The Homebrew formula in the tap repository is then updated with the new version URL and checksum. Users upgrade by running brew update and brew upgrade.
