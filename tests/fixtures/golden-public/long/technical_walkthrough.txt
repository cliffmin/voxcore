Let me walk you through the VoxCore architecture. When you press the hotkey, Hammerspoon starts recording audio through ffmpeg using the avfoundation framework. The audio is saved as a sixteen kilohertz mono WAV file. Once you release the hotkey, the recording stops and Hammerspoon calls the VoxCore command line interface. The CLI loads your configuration, reads any vocabulary hints from VoxCompose, and invokes whisper cpp for transcription. The raw transcript then passes through a ten stage post processing pipeline. This pipeline handles merged word separation, disfluency removal, sentence boundaries, capitalization, punctuation, and dictionary corrections. The final clean text is returned to Hammerspoon which pastes it at your cursor position.
