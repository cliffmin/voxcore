# Dependabot Configuration
#
# Strategy: Monthly updates with grouping to balance security with maintainability.
#
# - Monthly cadence: Reduces PR noise while staying current on security patches
# - Grouped updates: Batches patch/minor updates to minimize review overhead
# - Auto-merge: Paired with .github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml
#   to automatically merge passing updates
# - PR limits: Caps open PRs to prevent backlog accumulation
#
# For major version bumps, Dependabot creates individual PRs for manual review.
